	// ReadTimeout is the maximum duration for reading the entire
	// request, including the body.
	//
	// Because ReadTimeout does not let Handlers make per-request
	// decisions on each request body's acceptable deadline or
	// upload rate, most users will prefer to use
	// ReadHeaderTimeout. It is valid to use them both.

	// WriteTimeout is the maximum duration before timing out
	// writes of the response. It is reset whenever a new
	// request's header is read. Like ReadTimeout, it does not
	// let Handlers make decisions on a per-request basis.
	WriteTimeout time.Duration

	// IdleTimeout is the maximum amount of time to wait for the
	// next request when keep-alives are enabled. If IdleTimeout
	// is zero, the value of ReadTimeout is used. If both are
	// zero, ReadHeaderTimeout is used.
